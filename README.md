Realm Object Editor
==========
[Realm](http://realm.io) Object Editor is a visual editor where you can create your Realm entities, attributes and relationships inside a nice user interface. Once you finish, you can export your schema document for later use and you can export your objects in Swift, Objective-C and Java.

Using Realm Object Editor you will be able to:
* Create Realm Entities.
* Create the entities attributes and define the properties for each attribute (primary key, index, ignored, default value, etc...)
* Create one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.
* Set a perant class for each entity (the default is RLMObject for cocoa-based entities and RealmObject for Java entities)
* Export the designed schema into Swift, Objective-C or Java for Android.



Generated Files
========================
Each generated file, besid the getters and setters (for Java) will include:
* The defination for the primary key.
* The defination for indexed attributes.
* The defination for the ignored attributes.
* The defination for the desired attributes' default values.
